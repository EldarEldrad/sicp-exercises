This repository contains solutions for "Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs".
You can run these programs via any SCHEME interpreter. I recommend, to use Racket interpreter. You can easily get it using

apt-get install racket

You can run programs in Terminal just typing

racket FILE-NAME

Be careful, some exercises have solutions with endless looping. You can stop them in Terminal via standard Ctrl-C combination.
