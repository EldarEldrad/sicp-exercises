;this is completely mathematical exercise
;you should use induction to prove that
;first check if this true for Fib(1)
;indeed, it's obvious that (/ (phi - psi) (sqrt 5)) ===> 1
;then you should use definition of Fibonacci number: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)
;replace Fib(n-1) and Fib(n-2) with its representation through psi and phi, then simplify expression
;also, you need to use following equations: psi^2 = psi + 1 and phi^2 = phi + 1
